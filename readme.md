# To Do List

To Do API and frotnend, to manage to do tasks and place them within categories.
API is based on Java, and frontend is HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Documentation

All documentation, icnluding ERDs, UMLs, Risk Matrix, Presentation, and link to Issue Tracking board are located in `docs`
API documentation can be accessed through `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html` when the program is running (change 8080 to whichever port the API runs on)

## Getting Started

Download latest release. All dependencies should be included.
To compile from source: `mvn package`
Bypass tests: `mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true`
See **Running the Tests** below for important information on compiling and running test correctly

### Prerequisites

Java 11
MySQL for Production use

### Installing

Set program to use the MySQL database instead of H2 in-memory database by changing `spring.profiles.active` to `production` in `src/main/resources/application.properties`
Also set MySQL database name and credentials in `src/main/resources/application-production.properties`
Compile program from source using `mvn package`, and use the generated .war file as your release package

### Tests

Tests can be run with `mvn test`
Test reports for the backend are generated in `target/surefire-reports`
Code coverage reports are generated in `target/site`
Frontend extent reports are generated in `reports/frontend`

IMPORTANT: Please ensure frontend is running on a live server PRIOR to running the tests. (`mvn test` OR `mvn package`)
The link to the frontend can be set in `src/main/resources/application-test.properties`
**Test will fail if Surefire cannot communicate with the frontend**
Bypass tests: `mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true`
The frontend depends on setting cookies, and browsers do not set cookies for local webpages
